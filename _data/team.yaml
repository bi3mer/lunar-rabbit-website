   Laura Mo is a Computer Science student at Drexel University and one 
   of the developers and designers at Lunar Rabbit Games. She decided 
   that she would make video games after she played Pokemon Sapphire for 
   15 minutes in fourth grade and someone hasn't changed her mind since. 
   She is fascinated by procedural generation and computer simulations 
   for water. In her spare time she enjoys writing, drawing, sleeping, 
   and eating.

   Amy is a Game Art student who should probably sleep more. She's 
   interested in illustration, aesthetics, emotional soundtracks, and nice 
   hair. Drawing is her passion but she likes to do a little bit of 
   everythingâ€”someday she'll write that fantasy novel, but that day is 
   not today! She spends her spare time thinking too much about life, 
   the universe, and everything.
